	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p>This article goes over our findings for classifying chemical compounds based on their mutagenic affect on a particular bacterium.</p>
	<p>This effort was motivated by a desire to verify the validity of the results from <a target="_blank" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.05005">graph2vec</a>. Rather than directly reproducing the results by using an SVM classifier, we chose to use a deep feedforward neural network.</p>
	<p>We use the MUTAG dataset. It can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://ls11-www.cs.tu-dortmund.de/staff/morris/graphkerneldatasets">here</a>.</p>
	<p>We were able to achieve similar and sometimes better results and give an explanation of this in our <a href="#experiment-results">result summary</a> found later in this article.</p>

	<h3>Experiment Overview</h3>
	<p>The MUTAG dataset contains 188 chemical compounds that are labelled according to their mutagenic effect on a bacterium. </p>
	<p>The <a target="_blank" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.05005">graph2vec paper</a> split the data to use 90% for training and 10$ for testing. We similarly used 10% for testing, 10% for validation, and 80% for training.</p>
	<p>Here's a depiction of our model.</p>

	<h3>Experiment Results</h3>
	<p>Below, we'll compare the vanilla LSTM architecture to the LSTM with attention architecture w.r.t. loss minimization, loss minimization per parameter, and training time until convergence.</p>
	<p>There were 468 possible hyperparameter combinations for the vanilla LSTM architecture.</p>

	<h3>Conclusion</h3>
	<p>We've shown that attention mechanisms, though seemingly redundant, can yield better results in practice.</p>
	<p>Hopefully, the work here does not solely convey on the benefits of attention but also conveys the importance of practical experience. Learning through experimentation and practice yield far superior results to textbook study alone.</p>
